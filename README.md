# My Very First Website

 ## Welcome! [codeinstitute]("https://codeinstitute.net"). 

 This is my very first website, producing it has helped me learn all about Github.
 I have been taken through steps that have helped me create this site, 
 learnt how to create a repository, save my work through using commands and how to save my entire project to Github.

 The logs and process shown in this project will be useful for a junior coder, just starting out on their coding journey.

 In this project I used, github and gitpod.
